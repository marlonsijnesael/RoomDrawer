# RoomDrawer

### Prototype for 3D room drawing tool
W.I.P. roomdrawer: www.marlonsijnesael.nl/contourv3/#/drawer
##### Created using Babylon.js and Interact.js
As part of the rework for the Contour project we wanted to create an intuitive 3D floorplanner. <br>
I used the https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/workshop/House_Use tutorial as a starting point and used Interact.js in order to create an interactable SVG shape to modify the 3D room.  <br>

#### How to use:
Move:  
Draggable points are used to move corners around. 
<br>
Create:  
when a line is clicked, a new point is added to the room.
